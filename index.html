          Liability for Content<br>
          <br>

          The contents of our website have been created with the greatest possible care. However, 
          we cannot guarantee the contents' accuracy, completeness, or topicality. According to Section 7, 
          paragraph 1 of the TMG (Telemediengesetz - German Telemedia Act), we as service providers are liable 
          for our content on these pages by general laws. However, according to Sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, 
          we service providers are not obliged to monitor external information transmitted or stored or investigate 
          circumstances pointing to illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under 
          general laws remain unaffected. However, a liability in this regard is only possible from the moment of 
          knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the content 
          immediately.<br><br>

          Liability for Links<br>
          <br>
          Our website contains links to external websites, over whose contents we have no control. Therefore, 
          we cannot accept any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or 
          operator of the websites is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The 
          linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal 
          contents were not identified at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the 
          contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without specific indications of a violation. 
          Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.<br><br>

          Copyright<br>
          <br>

          The contents and works on these pages created by the site operator are subject to German copyright law. 
          The duplication, processing, distribution, and any kind of utilization outside the limits of copyright require 
          the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted 
          for private, non-commercial use. In so far as the contents on this site were not created by the operator, the copyrights 
          of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you become 
          aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. Upon notification of violations, 
          we will remove such contents immediately.<br><br><br>
